<p>Hello world, my name is Iman Fattah. I am a musician, audio technologist, and machine learning engineer from Indonesia, currently based in Los Angeles, CA.<br /><br />I have worked on various projects such as music production, sound design, sound for theater, film scoring, gallery exhibition, and fashion runway, to name a few. I accept projects that are both meaningful for me or aesthetically challenging: from non-profit independent experiment shows to big commercial projects for advertising agencies. Yes, I have bills to pay, but I never let it limit my creative pursuit.<br /><br />In addition to music and sound design, growing up in the &lsquo;90s means that I grew up alongside the video game and computer industry. Being a hardcore gamer myself, I am knowledgeable in multiple genres of gaming that shape today&rsquo;s video game landscape. The &rsquo;90 have also shaped my life as I witnessed how video game consoles developed from analog to digital format&mdash;directing my interest in both analog and digital music production. Being a musician, producer, writer, and gamer equips me with unique audio and visual sensibilities&mdash;utilizing technology as a tool for art-making.<br /><br />Now, I am fortunate to shift career and contribute to the world&rsquo;s top tech companies based in Silicon Valley, and working at the intersection of art and technology, all thanks to my experience with music and sound that brings me to where I am today.</p>
