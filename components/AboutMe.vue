            <p>Being born into a family that dedicates their lives for music is something that I consider a privilege: an Indonesian living legend bass player as a father and a fearless international concert promoter as a mother. I grew up breathing music in and out, and now I have collaborated and worked with inspiring people from all walks of life. I have worked on various projects such as music production, sound design, sound for theater, film scoring, gallery exhibition, and fashion runway, to name I few. I accept projects that are both meaningful for me or aesthetically challenging: from non-profit independent experiment shows to big commercial projects for advertising agencies. Yes, I have bills to pay, but I never let that limit my creative pursuit.</p>
            <p>I have picked up photography as a hobby, so I incorporate it into my creative process&mdash;trying to kindle myself via all sensories. I surprise myself with what I can do when I let photography inspires my music and sound creating, and vice versa. My photography works have been featured in National Geographic Traveller Indonesia twice, and have been exhibited in Yogyakarta and Berlin.​</p>
            <p>In addition to music and photography, growing up in the &lsquo;90s means that I grew up alongside the video game and computer industry. Being a hardcore gamer myself, I am knowledgable in multiple genres of gaming that shapes today&rsquo;s video game landscape. The &rsquo;90 has also shaped my life as I witnessed how video game consoles developed from analog to digital format&mdash;directing my interest in both analog and digital music production.​</p>
            <p>Being a musician, photographer, writer, and gamer equip me with unique audio and visual sensibilities&mdash;utilizing technology as a tool for art-making. This personal website is not just a marketing tool, it is also where I archive my thoughts and creative processes. Thank you for sharing this online presence with me, and feel free to explore!</p>
